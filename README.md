# A-90-Windows
A-90 from the hit Roblox game Doors on your PC !

## Description
Do you hate this guy that gets you killed each time you visit the rooms ? Now you can get him out of the game, directly on your PC !

## Behaviour
Pretty much like in the game, A-90 will first show a fakeout around the screen, and then, it will show you a stop sign telling you not to move. But move what, you might say ? Currently, it require you to **not move the mouse**.

Well, if you do, he will jumpscare you, and you will get a black screen. But don't worry, nothing is lost ! If you want to exit the program, just either open task manager, or run 

<sub> taskkill -f -im A-90-Windows.exe </sub> on a terminal or something, lol.
